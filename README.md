## wideloop

### What?

A repository that collects books, blogs, tips, and tricks for time series analysis.

### Why?

### "wideloop"?

tidy data:
1. Every column is variable.
2. Every row is an observation.
3. Every cell is a single value.

Data from government agencies is presented in a "long"[^1] format. To make it more manageable pivot the data to "wide"[^2] and create a for loop for each category!

[^1]: In the "long" format, each row of the dataset contains multiple observations for different categories, and there are usually two key columns: one for the variable names and another for the corresponding values.
[^2]: The "wide" format organizes data in a way that each unique value in the variable name column becomes a separate column in the output, with the corresponding values spread across those new columns.
