[^1]: In the "long" format, each row of the dataset contains multiple observations for different categories, and there are usually two key columns: one for the variable names and another for the corresponding values.
[^2]: The "wide" format organizes data in a way that each unique value in the variable name column becomes a separate column in the output, with the corresponding values spread across those new columns.
