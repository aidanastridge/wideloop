## ðŸ“ˆ Wideloop 

### What?

A stage to collect (mostly free) online books, articles, exercises, tips, and tricks for time series analysis in Python.

### Why?

Time Series modelling is complicated. I created this repository so I would always have handy resources that would make sense of it all and make me better. While I did start this repository because I thought it was hard to find **Python** methods â€” it isn't; Using Chat GPT and saving resources fixes the confusion. I have also added resources using **R** and **SAS** as guides.

### What is a "wideloop"?

To make public time series data in a **"long"**[^1] format **"tidy"**[^2] pivot to **"wide"**[^3] and then create a for-loop for each level!  
Commonly found in [Statistics Canada data.](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data)    
[Example](https://github.com/aidanastridge/wideloop/blob/main/wideloop/wideloop_example.ipynb)  
Unfortunately, it does not work in every case; I'm trying to fix this!

[^1]: In the "long" format, each row of the dataset contains multiple observations for different categories, and there are usually two key columns: one for the variable names and another for the corresponding values.
[^2]: Every column is variable.
Every row is an observation.
Every cell is a single value.
[^3]: The "wide" format organizes data in a way that each unique value in the variable name column becomes a separate column in the output, with the corresponding values spread across those new columns.
